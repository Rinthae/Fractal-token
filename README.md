# Fractal Token

This repository contains the smart contract `FractalToken.sol` which models a programmable real estate token inspired by the ERCâ€‘3643 standard. The contract tracks fractional ownership, governance power and enforces whitelist based transfers.

`FractalTokenFactory.sol` allows deploying new instances of `FractalToken` for
different properties using custom parameters.
